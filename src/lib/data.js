  {
    q: 'What does “research use only” mean here?',
    a: 'Every product on this site is sold strictly for in-vitro and laboratory research. Nothing here is a drug, supplement, or food. It is not for human or veterinary use, and we sell only to qualified researchers and institutions. The label and documentation say exactly that.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I know the purity is real?',
    a: 'Each lot is tested by an independent, ISO 17025-accredited lab using reverse-phase HPLC and mass spectrometry. The purity printed on the vial is the assay result, not a marketing figure. Scan the batch code on the cap to pull the matching certificate of analysis.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How is it shipped and stored?',
    a: 'Peptides are lyophilized (freeze-dried) and sealed under argon in amber borosilicate vials. Orders ship within 24 hours on business days with cold packs and tracking. Store lyophilized vials cold and away from light; reconstitution guidance is in every box.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is your reshipment policy?',
    a: 'If a vial arrives broken, or an assay you run in good faith disagrees materially with our COA, contact us with your batch code and we reship or refund — no return shipment required for damaged goods.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you offer bulk or recurring orders?',
    a: 'Yes. Lab accounts get tiered bulk pricing and standing monthly orders that ship automatically; pause or cancel any time in one click. Contact us with your institution details to open an account.',
